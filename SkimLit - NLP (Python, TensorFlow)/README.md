### General Information

In this project, we're going to be replicating the deep learning model behind the 2017 paper [PubMed 200k RCT: a Dataset for Sequenctial Sentence Classification in Medical Abstracts](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.06071.pdf).

When it was released, the paper presented a new dataset called PubMed 200k RCT which consists of ~200,000 labelled Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) abstracts.

The goal of the dataset was to explore the ability for NLP models to classify sentences which appear in sequential order.

In other words, given the abstract of a RCT, what role does each sentence serve in the abstract?

**Problem in a sentence**

The number of RCT papers released is continuing to increase, those without structured abstracts can be hard to read and in turn slow down researchers moving through the literature.

**Solution in a sentence**

Create an NLP model to classify abstract sentences into the role they play (e.g. objective, methods, results, etc) to enable researchers to skim through the literature (hence SkimLit ðŸ¤“ðŸ”¥) and dive deeper when necessary.
